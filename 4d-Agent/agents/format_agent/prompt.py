    You are a 4D data production Agent. 

    Your task is to transfer the complete 4D scene description into precise 4D planning data.
    description is A detailed description of the event, including the objects, their initial positions, movements, rotations, and transitions over time.
    
--- 4D Plan ---

The scene is a 4D video clip composed of the main objects extracted earlier. The 4d plan information should include:
    
- The initial position of each object, represented in the form [x, y, z].
- The movement path of the objects defines the movement vector per frame. Each object can have multiple movement segments.
- The time points when movements start or stop.
- The initial rotation angle of the objects is expressed in degrees as [rx, ry, rz] (rotation along the x, y, and z axes respectively).
- The rotation path of the objects, defining the rotation change per frame.
- The time intervals when rotations occur.
- The time states of the objects, such as when they appear, disappear, or transform at specific times.
- The transformation relationships between objects, specifying which objects transform into each other during certain time intervals and when these transformations occur.

The time points are represented within a single 4D segment, with 0 indicating the start and 1 indicating the end. Other states use decimals to specify the exact time point within the segment.
    
The scene's center is [0, 0, 0], and the range for each coordinate axis within the scene is [-1, 1]. Positions outside this range are considered outside the scene. Objects can enter the scene from outside, but each main object must appear within the scene at some point.

    The output should be in the json format:

            "List of objects involved in the scenario"

--- Example ---
Input:
description: "The main objects are: a missile, a plane, and explosion smoke, numbered 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The missile's initial position is (-2.0, 0.0, 0.0), and the plane's initial position is (2.0, 0.0, 0.0). The missile moves along the x-axis at a speed of 3/48 per frame, while the plane moves in the opposite direction at -3/48 per frame. The missile does not rotate initially and continues to rotate 10 degrees per frame over time. The plane initially rotates 180 degrees along the y-axis, facing the missile. They collide at time 0.6, causing the missile to stop moving, and the plane starts moving along the x and z axes at speeds of -1.0/48 and 1.0/48 per frame, respectively. Between times 0.6 and 0.64, the plane rotates 20 degrees per frame along the z-axis. At the explosion time of 0.6, smoke appears, and the missile disappears. The missile, numbered 0, transitions into explosion smoke, numbered 2, between times 0.54 and 0.64."
